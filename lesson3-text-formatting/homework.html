    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <h3>My Favorite Hobby</h3>
    <p>The main hobby I have is playing <strong> <em> video games</em></strong>, closely followed by playing guitar and listening to music. I have been playing video games for a while. Probably around eight years at this point. Its one of the most fun things to do for me. Whether thats making the video game and testing it out, or playing with my friends. I like a lot of games, though currently I am playing Call of Duty. The best games I ever played were <I>Red Dead Redemption</I>, for its story, <I>Subnautica</I>, for its story and world, <I>No Mans Sky</I>, for its world, <I>Ghost of Tsushima</I>, for its story and combat, the <I>Call of Duty Black Ops series</I>, for its great multiplayer, and <I>Minecraft</I> for its infinite building possibilities. All of these games to me are incredibly fun and I can play them nonstop. I love gaming because of how fun it is, though another reason I love it is how I can use it to stay connected to friends. </p>
<h3>Other Things I like</h3>
<P> I like a lot of other things to. Such as the aforementioned <strong>guitar</strong> and listening to <em>music</em>. I have been playing <strong>guitar</strong> for around three years and have preformed many different songs many different times for people. I love listening to music and collect <strong>records</strong> and play them. I also love tennis, <strong>volleyball</strong>, ping-pong and badminton. Especially <strong>volleyball</strong>. I love to play <strong>volleyball</strong> and want to get on the Bergen Tech team and play as opposite hitter. I play ping-pong and badminton with my family and I also love to swim in my pool. I love learning about things, especially science. And I like reading and like watching movies, especially <u>super-hero or action movies</u>. When it comes to music I like music from the 50's through 2000s. My favorite artist is <strong>Prince</strong>, followed by Michael Jackson and <em>Jimi Hendrix</em>. </P>
