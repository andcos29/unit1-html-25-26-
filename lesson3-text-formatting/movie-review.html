     <h1> My favorite movie review </h1>

     <!-- introduction with formatting  -->
      <p><strong> Batman Begins </strong> is absolutely the <em>best movie</em> I have ever seen! Its only competition is the comedy Bullet train, No country for Old Men, and the movie American Psycho. The plot is <u><b> rich in tension</b></u> and the VFX are <i>amazing</i></p>
