    <h2 id="#research">Trip Research</h2>
    <p> A perfect vacation for anyone to go on is a vacation to the historic and beautiful city of London. A great source that I use to gather information is the official <a href="https://www.visitlondon.com/" target="_blank">tourism page of London</a>. Visiting london can be tons of fun, in fact I have been to London twice and could still go back to see more. Whether it be the great food, which there is tons of in London literally every place I ate at was great in london, or the sight-seeing or the rich history means London has a little something for everything. For more information about the activities I suggest trip advisors amazing <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g186338-Activities-London_England.html" target="_blank">and informative tourism website</a>. London is medium in temperature in the summer, around 75 degrees. While colder in the winter. It is also generally on the rainier side during the winter and spring. For more information <a href="https://weather.com/weather/today/l/ae8230efd4bc57fdf721a02c7eb2b88c56aa6e71d73666328e33af3ea2039032132e24ae91b6a07862c5091a9d95a4b8" target="_blank">use this amazing weather app</a>. </p>

<h3>Flight and Booking information</h3>
<p>Hotels and flights can be difficult to get so I would use Booking.com's <a href="https://www.booking.com/city/gb/london.html?aid=1856183&pagename=london&label=msn-7iob_TQXW_DsoTy37ycOCQ-80539403954501:tikwd-80539563709181:loc-190:neo:mte:lp98647:dec:qsbooking.com%20london%5C&utm_campaign=United%20Kingdom&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=bing&utm_term=7iob_TQXW_DsoTy37ycOCQ&msclkid=c286b6d170b61914557ede15eb14cee5&utm_content=London%20-%20UFI%3A-2601889">Informative website</a> to get a hotel or reservation at any where. If getting a flight is difficult I would suggest using an app to get a flight. Specifically I would recommend Expedia's <a href="https://www.expedia.com/Hotel-Search?regionId=2114&locale=en_US&siteid=1&semcid=US.B.BING.BD-c-EN.HOTEL&semdtl=a1686792144.b11318316050701909.g1kwd-82395635035421%3Aloc-190.e1c.m16afc3c40ca3a1c89f05b548456052684.r130cfd165c0507957566614d31cba256319306681978d1731cb108aa85139337c.c1AWApAevYyKidixxTTWcgSQ.j198647.k141471.d182395011629818.h1e.i1.l1.n1.o1.p1.q1.s1.t1.x1.f1.u1.v1.w1&msclkid=6afc3c40ca3a1c89f05b548456052684&sort=RECOMMENDED&startDate=2025-09-26&endDate=2025-09-27&destination=London%2C%20England%2C%20United%20Kingdom&theme=&userIntent=&categorySearch=&useRewards=false&adults=2&children=&latLong&pwaDialog&daysInFuture&stayLength" target="_blank">very useful website.</a></p>
<h3>Transportation Info</h3>
<p>London is a big city, in fact its a huge city. And since it is in Europe with old style roads it can be pretty mazelike to navigate, so using local transport is a no brainer. The metro is confusing so I would use the <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/tube/" target="_blank">neat and handy Metro website</a>. If the metro is not your thing then London has other ways to get around. The most famous being its bus system, famous for its big double decker red buses. If you want to learn more about the bus system before your trip, as you should, I would go to Londons official <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/buses/">simple website to learn more</a>. And if you want taxi's well London has plenty. But Taxi's can be a bit confusing if you dont normally use them and this is in a different country so it is sometimes difficult to use. Thats why you should use this <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/taxis-and-minicabs/book-a-taxi">simple and handy website</a> that contains all the rules and what you can do to get a taxi.</p>
